Multithread console application that simulates a Police communication system, managing the picking up and detaining of suspects. Police and suspects are imported from csv files. Each police unit has its own thread and police are assigned to a suspect if one is available. Police with a suspect move to the kennel to get a dog or wait there until a dog becomes available. They then move to arrest the suspect, after arrest police return the dog and then return to the nearest station that has space. Runs for 60 ticks.
