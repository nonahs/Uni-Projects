Python 2 implementation of a drone allocation and localisation system called DALSys. DALSys is responsible for storing information on the drones and drone operators, including configuration  details, who is controlling which drones and where the drones are located. Connects to MySQL database to get information on drones, oeprators and maps. A GUI allows the user to update operaters and drones in the database and can also visually track them. Tracksystem.py was provided code as was the app-skeleton.py. The rest was built up over 3 iterations from a CLI implementation to the final GUI implementation. The GUI is an implementation of sketches that were drawn by a independant designer. Database was first designed as an ERD before being implemented. Uses Tkinter for the GUI and the MySQL connector for python for the database connection. Database connection details are handled at the bottom of app.py. SQL file is provided to initalize the database and add some dummy data for testing the program.
