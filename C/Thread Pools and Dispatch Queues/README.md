Operating Systems assignment on thread pools and dispatch queues. Program creates a thread pool to help minimise the cost of creating and destorying threads.Each task that is added to the dispatch queue is allocated a thread from the pool if available and returns the thread to the pool when done. Tasks can either be processes concurrently or serially depending on the type of queue and how the tasks are added. Concurrent queues dispatch tasks in the order they are added to the queue and runs tasks concurrently. Serial queues wait for the current task to complete before dispatching the next task. Mutexss and semaphores are used to control the concurrency. Tasks are either dispatched synchronously or asynchronously. If a task is added to a dispatch queue synchronously the call to add the task does not return until the task which was added to the queue has completed. If a task is added to a dispatch queue asynchronously the call to add the task returns almost immediately and the calling thread may run in parallel to the task itself. The normal way of adding a task to a queue is the asynchronous method. Pool size is determined by the number of cores on the system running the program. Tests and makefile were provided to test the code with different types of queues and dispatch methods. Test 4 should produce less than 10,000,000,000 and the task order may vary. Test 5 produces exactly 10,000,000,000 and the tasks are in order.
